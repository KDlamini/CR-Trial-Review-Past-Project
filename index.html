          <h2>THOR'S STATUS AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Thor is an Asgardian warrior-prince, the God of Thunder, and a self-proclaimed protector of Earth.</li>
            <li>Thor subsequently became well known for his actions on Earth, which included acting as a founding member of the Avengers despite being the only Avenger that is not from Earth.</li>
            <li>Thor is mostly known wielded the mystical war hammer Mjolnir, which controls the weather, but he himself has god-like strength, durability, and agility.</li>
            <li>Thor is based on the thunder god of the same name from Norse mythology. This version of the character was created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and Larry Lieber.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>PERSONALITY</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Originally, Thor was very arrogant and full of himself and sought battle to prove his strength and heroism. He was also very short-sighted, acting on impulse or however he felt justified.</li>
            <li>Thor believed that he was entitled to the Asgard throne, and eagerly awaited his coronation.</li>
            <li>For his reckless actions and behavior, Thor's father Odin stripped him of his powers, titles, and rights, banishing him to Midgard until he proved himself worthy of his power,</li>
            <li>The plan worked and he returned humbled and much wiser and even thanked his father for the lessons he learned.</li>
            <li>Thor has become a noble warrior and a man of honor. He now thinks through his actions, trying to compromise before fighting. He fights not for glory but for the greater good.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>POWERS</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Superhuman Strength: Thor has extraordinary strength, easily surpassing most other Asgardians. Typically in battle he will send opponents flying with a single blow, and has proven capable of outperforming a number of much larger opponents in tests of strength.</li>
            <li>Superhuman Stamina: Thor's advanced musculature is considerably more efficient than the musculature of a human. His muscles produce minimal fatigue toxins during physical activity, enabling him to exert himself at peak capacity for extended periods without tiring.</li>
            <li>Superhuman Speed: Thor as an Asgardian can move faster than even the finest human athlete regardless of his great size, build and body density.</li>
            <li>Atmokinesis: Though Thor's relying on Mjölnir has caused a lack of practice, Thor is able to control weather without relying on Mjölnir. So far he has been seen only creating rain and electricity without relying on Mjölnir.</li>
            <li>Electrokinesis: Thor is able to generate electricity from his body without relying on Mjölnir.</li>
            <li>Superhuman Longevity: Thor has a lifespan far longer than that of a human being. While not truly immortal, he is known to be over one-thousand years of age.
